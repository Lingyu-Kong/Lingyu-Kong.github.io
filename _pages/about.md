Hi! I am Lingyu Kong, a senior student majoring in Computer Science and Technology at Tsinghua University. With a profound passion for nature and physics, I embark on a journey of exploration fueled by curiosity, constantly seeking new knowledge and delving into uncharted territories. As a fervent dreamer aspiring to make a difference in the world, I am dedicated to leveraging artificial intelligence algorithms to expand human cognition and modeling capabilities of the natural world. My research interests lie in the development and design of AI algorithms to aid humanity in addressing challenges and solving problems across the realms of physics, chemistry, biology, and energy. Join me in exploring the intersection of artificial intelligence and natural sciences, and together, let's seek solutions to the challenges facing humanity.

My work and research
======
Currently, I am investigating the application of artificial intelligence algorithms in material design, synthesis, and property prediction. I am particularly interested in the foundation model of machine learning force fields, the automatic generation of new materials based on generative models, and self-driving laboratory researches.
