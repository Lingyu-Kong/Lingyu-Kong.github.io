Large-scale first principles molecular dynamics are crucial for simulating complex processes in chemical, biomedical, and materials sciences. However, the unfavorable time complexity with respect to system sizes leads to prohibitive computational costs when the simulation contains over a few hundred atoms in practice. We present an In-Distribution substructure Embedding Active Learner (IDEAL) to enable efficient simulation of large complex systems with quantum accuracy by maintaining a machine learning force field (MLFF) as an accurate surrogate to the first principles methods. By extracting high-uncertainty substructures into low-uncertainty atom environments, the active learner is allowed to concentrate on and learn from small substructures of interest rather than carrying out intractable quantum chemical computations on large structures. IDEAL is benchmarked on various systems and shows sub-linear complexity, accelerating the simulation thousands of times compared with conventional active learning and millions of times compared with pure first principles simulations. To demonstrate the capability of IDEAL in practical applications, we simulated a polycrystalline lithium system composed of one million atoms and the full ammonia formation process in a Haber-Bosch reaction on a 3-nm Iridium nanoparticle catalyst on a computing node comprising one single A100 GPU and 24 CPU cores.
